    "You are tasked with developing models to **predict customer churn** for a subscription-based service. Using the provided dataset, your **goal is to build two classification models: one using Logistic Regression and the other using Naive Bayes.** You will compare their performance, interpret the results, and provide insights into customer churn based on your findings. You will **use provided the Telco Customer Churn dataset**, which contains customer information such as demographic details, account features, and whether the customer has churned. Your **target variable is \"Churn,\" indicating whether a customer has left the service.**\n",

    "### Ensure you follow the below instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Evaluate both models using the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "• Perform 5-fold cross-validation on both models and report the averaged results.\n",
    "• If there are any missing values (there will be!), fill them in during a pre-processing step using two of the three common strategies outlined below. Do this for the entire dataset!\n",
    "* Use the most common value in the dataset that has a value for this feature/attribute\n",
    "* Use a default value to fill in for missing values. It can be anything.\n",
    "* Drop that feature all together and use only features that have values for all data points.\n",

    "In this question, you will be **using k-means to perform image compression**. Implement a **naïve version** of the k-means algorithm based on your understanding. Your **code must take the number of clusters k as input and perform k-means clustering on the given image** (test_image.png). Once the algorithm finishes running, the cluster centroids represent the top-k common colors in the image. **Iterate through each pixel in the image and assign the closest color to each pixel. Save and visualize the resulting image.** For reading and writing images, you can use OpenCV, which is an open-source computer vision toolkit. The following code will load the image into a NumPy array. You can use this as input to your K-Means algorithm.\n",
