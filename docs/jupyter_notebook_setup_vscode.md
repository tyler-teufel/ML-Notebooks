## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Python 3.x**: Verify that Python 3 is installed by running:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If Python 3 is not installed, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **VSCode**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. **Homebrew**: For macOS users, we will use Homebrew for installing `pipx`. Verify Homebrew is installed by running:

   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

   If Homebrew is not installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

4. **VSCode Python Extension**: Install the Python extension for VSCode. This provides support for Python development, including Jupyter notebooks.

   To install:

   - Open VSCode
   - Go to Extensions (`Cmd + Shift + X`)
   - Search for "Python" and install the extension published by Microsoft.

## Step 1: Install pipx

We will use `pipx` to install and manage Jupyter Notebooks in an isolated environment, ensuring that it doesn’t interfere with the rest of your system’s Python installation.

### Install pipx via Homebrew

For macOS, use Homebrew to install `pipx`:

```bash
brew install pipx
```

After installation, ensure that `pipx` is added to your system’s `PATH`:

```bash
pipx ensurepath
```

### Verify pipx Installation

To verify that `pipx` was installed correctly, run:

```bash
pipx --version
```

You should see the version of `pipx` that’s installed. Now, you’re ready to install Jupyter.

---

## Step 2: Install Jupyter with pipx

With `pipx`, we can install Jupyter in an isolated environment. This keeps your Python tools like Jupyter separate from the rest of your system, preventing conflicts and keeping everything clean.

### Install Jupyter

Use `pipx` to install Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pipx install jupyter --include-deps
```

This installs Jupyter Notebook in an isolated virtual environment and makes it available globally on your system. You can now run Jupyter from anywhere in your terminal.

### Verify Jupyter Installation

To confirm that Jupyter was installed correctly, run:

```bash
jupyter --version
```

You should see the version of Jupyter Notebook installed. To start Jupyter, you can use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch Jupyter in your default web browser, where you can create and run notebooks.

---

## Step 3: Setting Up VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks

Now that Jupyter is installed, let’s set up Visual Studio Code to use Jupyter notebooks seamlessly.

### Install Jupyter Extension in VSCode

VSCode has a built-in Jupyter extension that integrates with the Python extension. To install it:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to Extensions (`Cmd + Shift + X`).
3. Search for "Jupyter" and install the extension published by Microsoft.

### Open or Create a Jupyter Notebook in VSCode

1. Open VSCode.
2. Click on `File -> New File`, and save it with the `.ipynb` extension (e.g., `my_first_notebook.ipynb`). This will tell VSCode to treat it as a Jupyter Notebook file.
3. VSCode will prompt you to select a kernel (Python interpreter). Select the default Python 3 interpreter or any environment where you want to run the notebook.

### Running Code Cells in Jupyter Notebook

You can start writing and running Python code in the notebook:

- Write Python code in a cell.
- Run the cell by pressing the "Run" button or using the shortcut `Shift + Enter`.

---

## Step 4: Managing Python Packages for Jupyter Notebooks

You can manage Python packages required for your Jupyter notebooks without affecting your global Python environment.

### Using pip to Install Packages

You can install packages directly from your notebook using the `!pip install` command inside a notebook cell. For example, to install `numpy`:

```python
!pip install numpy
```

Alternatively, you can install packages using `pipx` from the terminal by activating the Jupyter environment:

```bash
pipx runpip jupyter install numpy
```

This ensures that packages are isolated within the Jupyter environment installed by `pipx`.

---

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you may encounter when setting up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode:

### Python Interpreter Not Found

If VSCode cannot find the correct Python interpreter, you may need to select it manually:

1. Open the Command Palette in VSCode (`Cmd + Shift + P`).
2. Search for "Python: Select Interpreter".
3. Choose the correct Python 3 interpreter (likely the one installed via Homebrew or `pipx`).

### Jupyter Not Found or Not Working

If VSCode prompts that Jupyter is not installed, ensure that Jupyter is installed via `pipx` and globally available. Run:

```bash
jupyter --version
```

If it’s not found, try reinstalling with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx reinstall jupyter
```

---

## Step 6: Conclusion

You have successfully set up Jupyter Notebooks locally using VSCode and `pipx` to manage Python environments! This setup provides a clean, conflict-free environment for working on Python-based machine learning or data science projects. You can now quickly open Jupyter notebooks and start coding without worrying about managing virtual environments or system-wide dependencies.

With this workflow, you can:

- Run Jupyter notebooks directly from VSCode.
- Manage dependencies and packages in an isolated manner using `pipx`.
- Quickly spin up environments for your machine learning and data science projects.

Happy coding!

## The above documentation was generated using ChatGPT model GPT-4o !

I fed all of the information I wanted into a prompt, with some minor modifications made after generation. ChatGPT was able to generate the entire .md file ready for download, which was pretty incredible.

**If you have access to the new model and feel like giving it a shot, here is the prompt I fed it to generate this file:**

_Could you by chance write up a markdown file with step by step documentation for getting started with Jupyter notebook development locally using vscode and python3? Please also include the steps for installing and utilizing pipx, as I plan on helping a colleague get ramped up utilizing this technology. Please be sure to properly organize each section and break it up, with code snippets and bash snippets for commands. I want to use this for documentation I am building around how to get started with these sorts of projects. Please explain as much as you can, assuming that the reader is fairly green when it comes to setting up environments, also assuming that the highest level of knowledge that they are familiar with is basic python for computational purposes, but are looking to delve into the world of machine learning._

**The response i received simply generated all the info, so I followed up with this:**

_Is there any chance you can generate all of this in a markdown file for me to download?_
